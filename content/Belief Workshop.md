BWG *page 98*:
 - A belief consists of:
	 - **characterization** of the belief
	 - **goal** associated with the belief
	 - intended **reward** for roleplaying the belief
 - "*I will dethrone my brother the king no matter the consequences.*"
	 - [[Broad Statements are Bad|Instead of simply saying]] "I don't like my brother," you have an **action** "dethrone" and a **condition** "no matter the consequences."
 - [[Types of Starting Beliefs]] 
 - [[Anchored Beliefs]]
 - [[Little Goals]]
 - [[Broad Statements are Bad]]
 - **Be Colorful**: Simple beliefs may lead to boring play. "Save the queen."
	 - Add characterization by writing the belief *in character.*
 - [[Work Together]]

- "I believe ... therefore I will ..." once you accomplish the second half, you can change your belief by simply editing the second half to continue perusing it. 
- Must be actionable and contestable.
