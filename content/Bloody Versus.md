- Use Bloody Versus if the potential conflict:
	- involves an important antagonist
	- puts a belief on the line
	- is the climax of a larger story
- You have two dice pools: *attack*, and *defend*.
- Take your weapon skill exponent and distribute them between your attack pool and defense pool.
- Add any **[[Bloody Versus Advantages]]**: ([[Weapons]], [[Armor]], prowess, [[Fields of Related Knowledge|FoRKs]], etc.) to each appropriate pool.
- Test Results:
	- **One Side Hits**: 
		- Loser takes [[Wounds]]. (See the [[Weapons]] rules) 
		- Winner describes his success. 
	- **Both Sides Hit**: 
		- Both sides take a wound. 
		- Make appropriate [[Steel]] tests. 
			- If one side [[Hesitation|hesitates]] more than the other, he is captured or runs off. 
			- If both sides pass their steel test, the higher attack decides to:
				- another round of conflict (with different skills) or
				- [[Forte]] [[Versus Tests|versus test]] to see who lasts longest or
				- [[Power]] versus test to capture them or
				- [[Speed]] versus test to escape them or
				- agree to call a draw.
	- **Neither Side Hits**: 
		- No side takes a wound. 
		- The higher defender decides to:
			- another round of conflict (with different skills) or
			- [[Forte]] [[Versus Tests|versus test]] to see who lasts longest or
			- [[Power]] versus test to capture them or
			- [[Speed]] versus test to escape them or
			- agree to call a draw.
