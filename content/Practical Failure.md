- Failure can lead to: 
	- **A New Test**. 
		- *My failed orienteering led me to a trap. Now test speed to avoid the trap.*
	- **Full Conflict**.
		- *Your failed sneak leads to a martial conflict with all the guards.*
	- **Unexpected Encounter**
		- *my failed orienteering test led to a monster's layer.* That monster can now become a recurring element of the story. 
	- **Obstacle Penalties**
		- +1 Ob or +2 Ob to future linked/related tests. 
		- *Failing to sneak, you now have a +1 Ob to either stay and fight or running away.*
		- *You insult someone so badly that the GM imposes a semi-permanent +2 Ob to all future social skills tests against them.*
	- **Gear Loss**
		- Lost forever
		- damaged
			- the GM can assign an Ob penalty to damaged goods until it's repaired.
		- lost and must be recovered through another adventure
		- The more drastic the failure, the more drastic the loss. 
	- **Injury**
		- (I have yet to read the injury rules, so revisit this once I've done that. See Codex pages 122 & 123 )
	- **Turning a Relationship**
		- Bad rolls can change the nature of a relationship you have from good to bad. 
		- This can be temporary or permanent. 
		- These can be the results of a failed social test, or even situational tests gone wrong
			- *failed stealing test, your friend finds you stealing and no longer trusts you.*
		- Just make sure the GM makes the true stakes clear.
	- **Destroying a Reputation**
		- If you fail the appropriate social test, or do something disreputable, you may lose 1D reputation permanently.
	- **Damaging Affiliation**
		- *Fail an accounting or Estate Management test? -1D affiliation.*
		- *Poor conduct causes your organization to be embarrassed because of you. -1D* 
	- **Apply Traits**
		- Failure fundamentally changes the character, giving them new [[Traits]].
		- Character traits: Scarred, branded, stigmatized
		- Die Traits: *Such as the Infamous trait.* 
		- Attribute caps 
		- [[Call On Traits]] are solely beneficial, do not grant these as a result of failure. 
	- **Trigger Instincts**
		- If they fail, test their instincts to get them into trouble.
		- *You never wear shoes? Your failure results with you walking on sharp glass.*
		- *You never accept an insult? Your failure is met with them insulting you every failed social test*
		- This attention to player character details shows you care and gives them a chance to earn [[Artha]]. 
- Take your time creating failure conditions. It's worth it if the twist is interesting. 
- Make it a discussion with the whole table, ask the other players what a good complication would be. [^1] 
- Complicate a failed roll with [[Bangs]]. [^1]
