- Players determine the three top priorities (things their [[Characters|character]] finds fundamentally important, and goals the player wants to achieve) for their character
- New character's are given three beliefs - these are his top three priorities in play.
	- These beliefs can be priorities for other players as well,[[Beliefs in Play#^c97c2c| they can riff off each other's beliefs]]. 
	- Beliefs are what drive the game play forward. See [[Beliefs in Play|Beliefs in Play]]
- Beliefs are explicitly stated motivations that [[Anchored Beliefs|connect to the setting and situation]].
	- "I must redeem myself for my crimes. Thus I will serve the ruler loyally"
	- "I love my friend's family. Thus I will protect his sister at any cost."
- Shape your character's beliefs by asking yourself: 
	- "what do I want out of this character in this situation? 
	- How can my character's beliefs reflect that?"
	- See more questions in the [[Belief Workshop|Beliefs Workshop]].
- Beliefs can change, [[Changing Beliefs|but only if it has been properly characterized by the player and approved by the GM]].

- More detail in belief creation is discussed in the character burner (See [[Belief Workshop]]).
