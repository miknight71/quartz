- Vincent Baker said about Burning Wheel: 
	> "Every moment of play, roll dice or say 'yes.'"
	> "If nothing is at stake, say 'yes' [to the player's request], whatever they're doing. Just go along with them. If they ask for information, give it to them. If they have their characters go somewhere, they're there. If they want it, it's theirs."
	> "Sooner or later, sooner, because [your game's] pregnant with crisis - they'll have their characters do something that someone else won't like. Bang! Something's at stake. Start the conflict and roll the dice."
	> "Roll dice, or say 'yes.'"
- Unless there is something at stake pertinent to the game's world and goals, just do it.
- When there is conflict, inside or outside the game, roll the dice. 
- So long as intent and task are clearly stated, the story will go somewhere.
