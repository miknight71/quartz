- When should we roll a wises test?
- First, when a player asks about a piece of knowledge, tue GM should ask if he already knows it or not. 
- If you know the answer to the player question you can:
	- [[Roll Dice or Say Yes|Say yes]]: tell them the information that you know. 
	- think of an interesting consequence to failure and Make a related wises test to give the information 
- If you don't know the answer:
	- Ask more questions to figure out their true intent. 
	- Ask if this would contradict
