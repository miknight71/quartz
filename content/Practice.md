- Practice improves skills at the cost of significant in-game time. 
- [[Practice Times (chart)|Consult the Practice Times chart to see what sorts of practice tests you're able to perform]].
- **Maximum Practice**: A character's maximum daily practice hours is three times his [[Will|Will]] exponent - up to a maximum of 20 hours.
	- [[All Day Every Day|You cannot practice while being taught]].
- **Using Practice in the Game**: When players are undertaking a long in-game task (working on the farm, meditating in the hills) they can count that period as practice for pertinent abilities.
- When the time is met, log the test note. 
- Players who have been absent from sessions can reintroduce their character as having been practicing. 
- Log your practice even if it isn't a full cycle. Once the cycle completes you earn the test.
