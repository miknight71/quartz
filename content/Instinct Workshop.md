- [[Instincts must be about you not those around you]]
- Make an [[Instincts|Instinct]] which:
	- gets you into trouble
	- adds flavor by defining some habitual behavior (*always have enough ingredients for soup*)
	- informs the GM about what sorts of scenarios you want to be in (*In a cave-in push your way to safety*) [^1]
- Gym Use instincts to set a scene
- More than any other bits. They need to be clear
