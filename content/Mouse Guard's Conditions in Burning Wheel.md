	- Hi there. [[Mouseguard|Mouse Guard’s]] twists and conditions were actually derived from the way failure works in Burning Wheel. We just formalized it to make it simpler to apply.
	- **As a BW GM, you are well within your rights to say**: “If you fail this Composition test, you stay up all night trying to get the letter to the duchess just right. It’s good, but you’ll be at +1 ob to all actions until you get a good night’s rest. “
	- “If you fail this Falsehood, your target believes the lie for now, but will soon realize he’s been hoodwinked and will start telling anyone who will listen what a manipulative person you are. You gain an Infamous Reputation as a liar in the district until you clear your name.”
- you can apply a penalty to a stat to allow the intent to succeeded when it would have otherwise failed. It also cleverly implements unwanted mental states like being angry or tired.
- Players need to spend limited checks to remove these conditions.

### Application
- Create a list of different and varied conditions to apply in a number of circumstances
	- hungry
