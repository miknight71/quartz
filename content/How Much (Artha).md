- Every game, each player should: 
	- accomplish at least one goal - earning them a persona point
	- play their belief's, instincts, or traits - earning fate
- Smart players may earn up to eight fate a session! Or up to three persona points and additional fate.
- If no artha is earned, players or GM are not engaging with the system, and should recallibrate their BITs.
