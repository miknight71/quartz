A character's increase in rank or title may call for his Resources exponent to increase by 1D. 
	- A raise in Resources should also mean a raise in [[Lifestyles (Obstacles)|Lifestyle bills]].
	- The GM is the sole decider on a Title's influence on resources. Such a raise should be handled with care. 
	- If the Title is lost, the exponent should be removed.
