> With all of the talk lately about the value of Bloody Versus and Judd’s post about using BV for mass combat, I started wondering about a “mid-way” mechanic between versus social tests and the Duel of Wits.

 So, what about a mechanic that has the speed of a versus test with the compromises of a Duel of Wits?

There are some suggestions on [this RPG Stack Exchange answer 1](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/q/27516/2570) that are very similar to yours: make an opposed roll and then use the difference to determine compromises. For example, here’s Aramis’ suggestion:  
Use the compromise page in the book.  
Original body of argument = winner’s successes.  
Body of argument remaining = winner’s successes - loser’s successes.

One thing I like about BV is the way that, sometimes, it’s a couple of rolls. Like you’ll circle around each other trading wary attacks on the first go, and then end up wrestling or trying to wear each other down or whatnot. I’d love to see a Witty Versus that has some element of that as well.

> A couple ways to get it to 2-3 rolls like a BV would be to make it a Linked Test, perhaps with the first round a versus social (or other) test trying to gain advantage (+1D). Also, if there is a tie (assuming you have 2 aggressors), you could go to round 2 using different social skills.

Also, I like Aramis’ method for compromises better. Less math.
