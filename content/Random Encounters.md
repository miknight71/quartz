- Random Encounter Tables should be created on a game-to-game, or even session-to-session basis. 
- These encounters must be tied to each bullet below: 
	- character [[Beliefs]], [[Instincts]], and [[Traits]]. 
	- game [[World]]
	- the current [[Situations]]. 
- Meditate on all these elements and craft tables of random events that may appear at any given time. 
- A random encounter must advance the plot, or deepen characters (pc or npc).
- Random encounters can be used to: 
	- apply pressure when players are not making decisions to force them into action. (especially true if the players are not yet adept at engaging their BITs)
	- create an interesting narrative twist on a failed test.
	- throw in some random fun that you wouldn't have the chance to get to otherwise. 
- Roll a D12. 10 is a warning or a foreshadowing of something dangerous. 11 is encountering the danger. 12 is something fantastic. 
- Roll your encounters when there is a lull in gameplay, or when players are doing something mundane. 
	- Going to the market? It may be important, but it sounds boring. Go ahead and roll an encounter. Sure, they go to the market, but something interesting *may* also happen.
