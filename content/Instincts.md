- An "If/Then" or "always/never" statement for the character's behavior that players program into the character.
	- "If I see trouble, Then I draw my sword."
	- "If there's danger, Then I push the youngest to safety."
	- This allows you to telegraph how you want to play your character, how they act in certain situations.
- Characters have three instincts - action priorities for the character. 
- [[Always Never When or If-Then|The instinct must always be done, even if it's unannounced]] (at the player's discretion). 
- [[Insurance|Instincts can be used to protect yourself against a rules lawyering GM.]] 
- [[Changing Instincts|Instincts can be changed when deemed appropriate by the GM]].
- [[Instincts must be about you not those around you|Bad Instincts Exist]].
