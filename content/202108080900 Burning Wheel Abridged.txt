# The Garden is Burning

# Fire in the Garden
- Nothing matters without the characters
- Making characters is detailed.
- Character creation choices have consequences for each path you choose. 
- This process makes complex characters with strengths, bruises, and story fuel.
- Before you've even thought about backstory, you get a glimpse into your character's life, and see them ready to make an ejoyable game.

78

## From the Day Your Were Born...
- The basic mechanic of character creation is the lifepath

### Lifepaths
- Lifepaths are the culmination of short slices of life leading to where he is now.

### Setting
- Lifepaths are grouped into "settings," different strata of life or geography.
- You must choose lifepaths from the setting you're born into, unless you follow a lifepath lead to a new setting.

### Character Stock
- There are four different stocks (races) to choose from, and you may only choose lifepaths from your chosen stock. 
- However, you use the same core rules for all stocks.
