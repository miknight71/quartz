> The mechanics of it are quite simple. You get X lifepaths, each of which grants you a bunch of stuff. There are restrictions on where you can go from each one. They give you traits. And so on. You can explain all that in probably five or ten minutes.

> Burning characters takes a long time because there are very long lists and people keep rethinking what they want as they realize they’re on strange trajectories or there’s a lifepath they missed that they really want or that they can’t afford shoes. And that part doesn’t always become much faster with experience; a lot of what in other games would be purely thinking about character backstory and the like is mechanical in BW.

> I think it’s okay to do it with just one books as long as there’s plenty of discussion aloud about what’s being chosen and why and what it means. That way each character burned is also a little bit of a tutorial in chargen and the rules of BW.[^1]
