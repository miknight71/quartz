- How a character is played (intentionally or not) changes him.
- After a campaign/adventure, players and GM nominate characters to add new traits.
- All other players besides the nominee vote to accept the new traits. Unanimous agreement adds the trait. 
- Nominated traits should be a reflection of what's been happening in the game. 
- Optional. The player in question can't talk
