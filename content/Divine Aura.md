- Spending a aristeia to ignore all wound or other die penalties while accomplishing one single goal. 
- The goal must be stated before purchase (to escape, win this battle, sway the court to my side)
- If you have to disengage a goal (the enemy gets away, and you'll need to fight him later) the aristeia is lost.
