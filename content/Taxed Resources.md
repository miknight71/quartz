- On a failed resource test, the player does not get his [[Intent]], but also loses a Resource die temporarily (tax).
- The amount your resources are taxed depends on how [[Routine, Difficult and Challenging|challenging]] the roll was:
	- Routine Test: -1D tax
	- Difficult Test: -2D tax
	- Challenging Test: -#D tax equal to the margin of failure. 
		- (*rolling 7 dice against a Ob 5 and only getting 2 successes results in a -3D tax*)
- On a failed roll the GM may choose to grant the [[Gift of Kindness]].
- [[Depleting Resources|Resource exponent permanently depletes by 1 when you reach exp 0]].
- [[Recovering Resources]] 
- **Consolidate your losses**: eliminate your current tax by permanently reducing your exp by 1, and discarding your Resource tests for advancement.
