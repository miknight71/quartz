- If i have a repository synced online, on my pc, and on my phone. THen I start a series of documents on my PC. I push my PC's notes then leave home without pulling the latest notes to my phone. Later I take a few fleeting notes on my phone. After taking several notes on my phone I realize I need to see something from my PC's latest push. Can I pull my PC notes to my phone without GIT deleting my phone's notes?
