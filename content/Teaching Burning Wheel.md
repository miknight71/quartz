- First thing is dice
	- d6 die pool. The number next to a stat or skill indicates the number of dice you roll. Example.
	- You need to roll 4s or better for successes.
	- Need to roll enough success higher than an obstacle, or higher than your opponents successes. 
- Beliefs. The most important thing. 
	- One belief should be changing per session. 
	- At the beginning of a session, we discuss what we want to play today, then write appropriate beliefs towards that end. 
	- Next session, the situation and context has changed, so you likely have to change your beliefs. The goal is different, your relationships may be different. Write new beliefs. Z

	- Also send players the "How can I be a better player" section. 


Use the two above guides as a basis for constructing two different rules summaries. Each part links to the rule book portion. 

Using SUSD Mastering The Teach guide, we need to hit three elements in short succession:
1. Who are we playing as
2. What is the goal / how do we win
3. WHy is this going to be fun

https://rpggeek.com/thread/1029982/what-did-i-do-wrong-sword-and-duel-wits Review about explaining beliefs

### See video: Why Any Tutorial You Remember Playing Sucks
- Make the TEACH, EXCITE, COMFORT, and RESPECT the players
	- Don't allow them to make an uninformed decision. Weave learning into the gameplay experience. Make sure they have a grasp on the basic mechanic before moving forward. 
	- Don't overload players with information. Only introduce basic user interface as needed. 
	- Don't inturrupt gameplay with wall of exposition. (portal starts without portal gun, then gives you gimped gun. then gives you full gun.)
- Bite sized pieces. 
	- Introduce elements gradually. 
- Introduce mechanics in a safe environment. Players need to observe while safe before being asked to interact on their own. 
	- Put the spotlight on new elements you need to learn about. 
- Guiding the players.
	- Use color, lights, cabels, or other elements in the world to create an obvious path (Mario trail of coins)

Applying the video:
- Introduce basic concepts in game first
	- Scenario set up
	- One of each character's beliefs 
	- How dice rolling works. 
	- Standard test
	- Versus test
	- Using skilled ability
	- Using unskilled ability
	- When someone is going to lose, tell them about artha
	- Describe the world visually, leading them to where they need to go. 
	- A helping situation. 

### Mastering the Teach
- Know the rules
	- Play a dummy game where you play all the roles
	- Take notes on rules clarifications as you come across them. 
- Let people fiddle with things
- Preamble: Who, What, Why
	- Who are we? [[#^b92248]]
	- How do we win? [[#^7ff1be]]
	- WHy will this be fun? [[#^1a0df3]]
	- "This is .... WE are ... who are doing ... We will be doing MECHANIC ... The one who does ... wins. I love this game. ..... Also, this cool thing...."
- Rehearse. 
	- Determine the different, discrete talking points that players need to know to play the game. 
	- Create a road map of which talking point should lead to which. 
	- Make sure the road is mapped in such a way you only teach what is relevenet to what players have learned already. 
- Use your friends as examples.
	- Don't say "red player does this."
	- Say "Suppose you, josh, own this shop. Then Mike comes in and does..."
	- We're hard wired to pay attention to stuff about us. 
- Create an environment people are comfortable asking questions
	- "Im available to answer any questions at all."
	- "Ooo, that's a fantastic question. Hold that thought and I'll get back to it. "
- Flight attendant
	- Don't teach together with someone else who knows the rules. You'll step on eachothers toes. 
	- One is just an assistent. 
	- Point at examples. Use examples. Ask questions the teacher missed. 
	- Get snacks for everyone else. 
- Careful how you play.
	- Don't wipe the floor with your friends. 
	- Be so focused on making sure your friends are getting the rules right and having fun that you can't win. 
	- Newbies feel that winning get's them into games. Play on that. Let them have tons of fun. 
- Play a few dummy rounds. 
	- Fudge the rules a little bit. 
	- Keep secret info open. 
	- "I'm doing this because..."
	- Then just reset. 
- Building blocks
	- Play smaller games that contain the mechanics in the bigger game.
	- Once they've played the smaller games, they'll be much less overwhelmed when seeing these same mechanics again, just recombined. 
	- Introduce one game at a time. 
	- This is foundational learning. 


**Applying the Video**
- **Foundational Learning**: Create a scenario which introduces one mechanic at a time, and allows several players to use each mechanic as introduced.
	- Intent & Task
	- Roll standard test based on stats
	- Mark advancement (just tell them which difficulty it falls under) 
	- Roll standard test based on skill
	- Failing a roll
	- Advantage
- Don't front load the character sheets. 
	- Give them a blank one, make sure they print it out.
	- As the game goes on, drip feed necessary character information that they can fill in along the way. 
	- Use mechanics related to the information imputed. 
	- Drip feed more stats.
