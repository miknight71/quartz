From *[I played a mute character with the instinct, “I can always get the gist of my point across.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningWheel/comments/sp9my2/i_played_a_mute_character_with_the_instinct_i_can/)
- [[Instincts]] are macros which describe a reaction to a stimulus. 
- Instincts are not predetermined responses other characters have to your actions. 
	- For instance: "*My mute character 'always gets his point across'*". This would effect the thoughts and feelings of people outside of your own character. This is a bad instinct. 
- Furthermore, when creating an instinct, it shouldn't be made to get you out of trouble, [[Fun (working title)|it should be made to get you into more trouble]].
	- A mute getting his point across gets you out of trouble more than it gets you into trouble. 
- In other words: Instincts don't let you auto-succeed challenges. 
	- Rather than "always get's my point across" it could be "always carries my trusty chalkboard."
