- How steady a character's nerves are in the face of fear, surprise and hesitation. 
- Steel tests are called for due to:
	- [[Surprise]]
	- [[Fear]]
	- [[Pain]] (the only repeatable Steel test)
	- [[Wonderment]]  
	- [[Intimidation]]
	- [[Aura of Fear]]
	- [[The Fear Spell]]
	- [[Forge Masks]]
	- and other effects. (effects can only cause a Steel test once per scene)
- The Ob for any Steel test is determined by subtracting your [[Will]] from 10. The result is your [[Hesitation]].
- When rolling for Steel, **[[Open Ended Rolls|sixes explode]]**.
- You may not [[Fields of Related Knowledge|FoRK]] skills in a Steel test, and likely can't be [[Help|helped]].
- Each successful die in a Steel test removes one beat of hesitation.
	- Or, the player misses the next test. 
- Failing a Steel test means the player loses control of the character due to their character's shock. He may:
	- [[Stand and Drool]]
	- [[Fall Prone and Beg for Mercy]]
	- [[Run Screaming]]
	- [[Swoon]]
