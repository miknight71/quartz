### One-Off 
- Don't bother tracking advancement
- make the game about one, single goal. 
	- "find the orb", then make some obstacles between them and the orb. 
	- The the players the goal before [[Character Burning]]
- Focus on one belief. 
- Focus on the players who are most driven if others are not. 
### Short Campaign
- Make two goals
	- One which is explicit
		- Try to reach the first goal by the end of the second or third session. 
		- Open the first session with an action scene which challenges beliefs right out of the gate. 
	- A second which emerges after working towards that goal, failing that goal, or succeeding that goal.
		- It's like the midpoint of a story, where the twist happens. 
- 4-15 sessions. 
- Players should also have immediate goals/beliefs which are changed each session. 
- Do [[Trait Vote]]s after campaign goals are met. 
### Long Campaign
- The way Burning Wheel is meant to be played
- Long campaigns need to start with action too. 
- Track advancement
- [[Take Notes|A player should take notes]] on important NPCs, important events, compromises, places, etc.
- You may use the [[Lifestyles (Obstacles)]] and [[Practice]] mechanics well.   

### Practical Action
- [[Roll Dice or Say Yes|Say yes]] if there is no interesting options for the player to take. 
	- "Will the player do *this* or will he do *that?*"
- Can you defeat the giant by yourself? No. There is no options. Just say yes. But if you ask "Can I outsmart him?" there are new possibilities that arise. 

### Practical Situation
-  Saving the world sounds fun and heroic, but burning wheel works better with smaller goals.
