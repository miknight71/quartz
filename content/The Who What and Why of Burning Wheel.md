- **WHO**: We are playing in a gritty, low fantasy world where your actions have consequences. This isn't a game about creating murderhobos, it's a 14th century fantasy life simulator. There is no premade world or characters, we make all of that together before we play the first session. ^b92248
- **WHAT**: In the game mechanics, your objective is to complete or dramatically fail to complete your character's goals. Doing so earns you Artha points. These are points that you can use to improve your character, reroll failed rolls, and otherwise help you do the things you want to do.  ^7ff1be
- **WHY**: I love that in this game your actions always have consequences. In d20 sometimes you fail a roll and nothing happens. Here, if you fail a roll - any roll - the story keeps moving, and you can get rewarded for failing. Gaining artha pushes you to put your character into tense and sticky situations that are both logical and exciting. This keeps the game moving forward at a cinematic pace. You're also incentivised to make bad decisions, because the game awards you with more artha points, which leads to even more exciting and nail biting situations. Another awesome tid bit is that by players setting their character's goals it in essense lets the players direct the gameplay to be how they like. Want slimy social intrigue? Write character goals beliefs about that. Want harrowing action adventures? Write goals about that.  ^1a0df3
